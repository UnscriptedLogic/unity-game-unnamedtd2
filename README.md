# UnnamedTD2: From The Ground Up
Welcome to the repository of UnnamedTD2/ProceGenTD (still can't decide on a good name). From the small limelight I've gotten from UnnamedTD (GLProject2022), I had decided to remake the game. 

UnnamedTD2, much like its ancestor UnnamedTD, is a tower defense game where a map made out of nodes is randomly generated from the debris placed, to the height maps and the pathway the enemies take.

### New Mechanic: Upgrade Options
Instead of just optimizing parts of the game with better code, I have decided to add an extra layer of gameplay called "Upgrade Options" where instead of upgrade paths like BloonsTD6, these upgrades operate like a multiple choice question where you are presented n number of upgrades but may only choose 1 per level. The design behind this was initially meant to invoke upgrade harmony where certain choices of upgrades operate better when paired together in different levels but after discussing its possibilities with friends, it also opened up ideas to a similar style to BloonsTD series of having the same tower have different purposes (Core, Support) when certain upgrades are bought together.

### New Mechanic: Abilities
Towers now have abilities much like that of MOBA games, attaining them as you upgrade your tower and levelling them up as your tower gains experience from dealing damage. In this way, towers can remain even more unique even when their weapons and attack style remain similar. Some enemies may also have abilities to increase their survivability on the field.

### New Visuals: Humanoid Entities
The project is also seeing a facelift graphically. Straying away from the static tower models and primitive shaped enemies, the entities are now animated humanoids. While still new to modelling, rigging and animating, I will do my best to bring life to the models.

The timeline of the project remains unknown and highly variable.

### What happened to UnnamedTD2
For some of you, you might be wondering why it looks different. Yes there was indeed another version of UnnamedTD2 that had terrain generation with perlin noise like a child's attempt at replicating Minecraft's terrain generation. While it seemed cool, it did not feel right. Either I lack the game design knowledge on how to conduct such an idea or it was simply my hopeless attempt at staying relevant, that project has been dropped. I will however, be bringing over the multi-upgrade option upgrade mechanic because I believe that it still has potential to shine and lot's of room to play with.

So yes, I remade the project AGAIN. However, I do believe this project can still go somewhere. With the simplified terrain generation back, I was able to optimize it greatly from utilizing new found knowledge like the Poisson Disc Sampling to spread out path points optimally, Roy's comically fast A* pathfinder and the slowly expanding functionality of the UnscriptedLogicLibrary, this project has seen a more stable foundation and I trust myself to not give up after failing twice and to take my time building this project,
