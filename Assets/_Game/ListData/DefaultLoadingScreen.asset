    title: Discovered Ruin Portals
    tip: The scouting crew stumbled upon these seemingly incomplete portals during
      their expedition to the ruins. Some believe the monsters came from them while
      others believe it serves a greater purpose we have yet to understand.

    title: Teamwork
    tip: Every tower has it's strengths and weaknesses. Some only begin to shine
      in the late game while others scale faster in the early game. Some have early
      game passives while other's have late game passives. Know them well!

    title: 'Log 1: Treading the ruin plains'
    tip: Our research has led us far into the ruins. The pictures of what seems to
      be a broken portal is true. Although we came here for answers, it seems all
      I am left with is more questions. Is it really a portal? Where does it lead
      to? Is it the cause for these monsters?
